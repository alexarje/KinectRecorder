KinectRecorder  
==============

Version: 	   0.1  
Created date:  2013-01-21  
Modified date: 2013-01-21  

What can it do? 
----------------

KinectRecorder allows for easy recording of one combined video file from the two inputs (regular video image and depth image) coming from a Kinect sensor device. The patch is not particularly fancy, but I imagine that it could be useful for other people interested in recording video from the Kinect, either for analytical applications or for testing performance setups when not having access to a Kinect device. 


Usage
------

Kinect your Kinect sensor, open the patch, start the video input, and start the recording. Files will be stored with MJPEG compression and named with the current date and time.


Example video
--------------

This [example video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WplkU20gidc) shows a recording of some basic movement patterns recorded with the KinectRecorder. This application allows for easy recording of one combined video file from the two inputs (regular video image and depth image) on a Kinect sensor device. This may be useful for analytical applications or for testing performance setups when not having access to a Kinect device.
